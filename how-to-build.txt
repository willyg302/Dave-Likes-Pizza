How to build Dave Likes Pizza
-----------------------------

1. Use a JavaScript minifier (I like UglifyJS: http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/uglifyjs) on the contents of the src/ directory, compressing them into a single file called dave-min.js (keep this file in the src/ directory)

2. Copy the following file structure to the remote host:
	/
	|---src/
	|	|---dave-min.js
	|
	|---lib/
	|	|---crafty-min.js
	|	|---sagittarius-min.js
	|
	|---assets/
	|	|---*.png
	|	|---*.mp3
	|	|---*.ogg
	|
	|---index.html


NOTE: You should use index-debug.html for all modifications, as index.html contains only a reference to dave-min.js (which would be hard to modify).
